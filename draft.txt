INIT (Global Variable)

A: list of int: empty: store the current deque
B: list of int: empty: store element to be removed
max: int: 0: current the most biggest number
base: int: 0: base of the only range
it: iterator to list of int: NULL: point to the only range


        type: 1: no element, 2: just one element, 3: a range
