## deque_permutation

### status: 
* a recusion algorithm (20171004)
* deque0: debug version of deque1
* deque1: deteminate whether one permutation is obtainable
* deque2: deteminate how many permutations of n elements are not obtainable
* deque3: frame of a new algorithm
* deque4: save output to file version of deque3
* deque5: a single case debug version of deque3

### subgoal
* give a thorough and formal description of the algorithm in deque3
* demonstate the problem of deque3
* and propose a possilbe solution

### goal
* aim to get an correct O(n) algorithm
